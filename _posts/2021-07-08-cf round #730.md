# [A: Exciting Bets](https://codeforces.com/contest/1543/problem/A)

```
Welcome to Rockport City!

It is time for your first ever race in the game against Ronnie. To make the race interesting, you have bet 𝑎 dollars and Ronnie has bet 𝑏 dollars. But the fans seem to be disappointed. The excitement of the fans is given by 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑎,𝑏), where 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑥,𝑦) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers 𝑥 and 𝑦. To make the race more exciting, you can perform two types of operations:

Increase both 𝑎 and 𝑏 by 1.
Decrease both 𝑎 and 𝑏 by 1. This operation can only be performed if both 𝑎 and 𝑏 are greater than 0.
In one move, you can perform any one of these operations. You can perform arbitrary (possibly zero) number of moves. Determine the maximum excitement the fans can get and the minimum number of moves required to achieve it.

Note that 𝑔𝑐𝑑(𝑥,0)=𝑥 for any 𝑥≥0.
```

## 세줄 요약

1. 정수 a, b가 주어진다.
2. a, b 값에 둘 다 1을 더하거나 빼는 연산을 할 수 있다.
3. 이 연산에 최소화를 통해 얻을 수 있는 gcd 최댓값과 연산이 실행된 횟수 구한다.

## 처음 생각
- a, b값이 크기에 O(1) 연산임을 추측할 수 있다.
- a == b일 경우 둘 다 1을 더하면 계속 돌아가니 문제에서 나온 infinite excitement는 a == b일 때이다.
- ...

## 풀이
- GCD(a, b) = GCD(a-b, b) if <b>a>b</b>
- <b>a - b</b> does not change by applying nay operation. However, <b>b</b>  can be changed arbitrarily.
- The maximum excitement the fans can get is <b>g = | a - b |</b> and the minimum number of moves required to achieve it is <b>min(a mod g, g - a mod g).</b>

```python
from sys import stdin, setrecursionlimit, maxsize
from collections import deque
from math import gcd


input = stdin.readline
# setrecursionlimit(10**6)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a==b:
        print(0,0)
    else:
        g = abs(a-b)
        m = min(a%g,g-a%g)
        print(g,m)

# [B: Customising the Track](https://codeforces.com/contest/1543/problem/B)

```
Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into 𝑛 sub-tracks. You are given an array 𝑎 where 𝑎𝑖 represents the number of traffic cars in the 𝑖-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as ∑𝑖=1~𝑛∑𝑗=𝑖+1~𝑛|𝑎𝑖−𝑎𝑗|, where |𝑥| is the absolute value of 𝑥.

You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.

Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.

# [C: Need for Pink Slips](https://codeforces.com/contest/1543/problem/C)

```
After defeating a Blacklist Rival, you get a chance to draw 1 reward slip out of 𝑥 hidden valid slips. Initially, 𝑥=3 and these hidden valid slips are Cash Slip, Impound Strike Release Marker and Pink Slip of Rival's Car. Initially, the probability of drawing these in a random guess are 𝑐, 𝑚, and 𝑝, respectively. There is also a volatility factor 𝑣. You can play any number of Rival Races as long as you don't draw a Pink Slip. Assume that you win each race and get a chance to draw a reward slip. In each draw, you draw one of the 𝑥 valid items with their respective probabilities. Suppose you draw a particular item and its probability of drawing before the draw was 𝑎. Then,

If the item was a Pink Slip, the quest is over, and you will not play any more races.
Otherwise,
If 𝑎≤𝑣, the probability of the item drawn becomes 0 and the item is no longer a valid item for all the further draws, reducing 𝑥 by 1. Moreover, the reduced probability 𝑎 is distributed equally among the other remaining valid items.
If 𝑎>𝑣, the probability of the item drawn reduces by 𝑣 and the reduced probability is distributed equally among the other valid items.
For example,

If (𝑐,𝑚,𝑝)=(0.2,0.1,0.7) and 𝑣=0.1, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be (0.1,0.15,0.75).
If (𝑐,𝑚,𝑝)=(0.1,0.2,0.7) and 𝑣=0.2, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be (𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑,0.25,0.75).
If (𝑐,𝑚,𝑝)=(0.2,𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑,0.8) and 𝑣=0.1, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be (0.1,𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑,0.9).
If (𝑐,𝑚,𝑝)=(0.1,𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑,0.9) and 𝑣=0.2, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be (𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑,𝐼𝑛𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑑,1.0).
You need the cars of Rivals. So, you need to find the expected number of races that you must play in order to draw a pink slip.
